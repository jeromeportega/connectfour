### Initial Thoughts

- Thinking of game logic, I know there are certain objectives that must be achieved.
1. Make sure the game alternates turns as players place pieces.
2. Players cannot play a piece if the column is full.
3. Check if there is a winner every round, using the location of the most recently placed piece for reference.
4. Make the computer pick a random column and send a piece.
5. If the board is full without a winner, stop the game and let the player reset.
